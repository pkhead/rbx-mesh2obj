# rbx-mesh2obj
A program to convert ROBLOX's .mesh file format to an .obj file format.

This only reads versions 1.00, 1.01, and 2.00

Download and compile the C++ code and provide the program with two arguments when running: the first being the source file and the second being the destination path.

(Not sure if this works on not Windows...)
